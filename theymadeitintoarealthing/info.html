	the most valuable idea in the universe

</div>
	<div id="text1">
The idea for this website all started when I had the idea for an astronaut helmet fish bowl.
As I was walking up the stairs expressing my creative idea with youthful ambition, my girlfriend, on crutches, burst out “They already made that!” I held myself back from tripping her crutches out, as we ascended to the second floor. With bountiful refrain I continued guiding her up the steps. Then, all of the sudden, I had yet another genius idea. “THEY SHOULD MAKE A MEME OF THAT!!…about believing you came up with your own original idea, but only to realize, its already been done, ‘they already did that!’” My girlfriend now holding back tears looks at me with immense sympathy, “Avi…they already made that into a real thing” </div>
